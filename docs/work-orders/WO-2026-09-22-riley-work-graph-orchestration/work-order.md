# Work Order — Riley work-graph orchestration

- Work Order ID: WO-2026-09-22-riley-work-graph-orchestration
- Status: active
- Requester: repository owner
- Orchestration owner: Riley Morgan / `ai-orchestrator`
- Current Work: CW-44 — Riley — work graph orchestration capability
- GitHub issue: #197 — Add Riley work-graph orchestration capability
- Branch: `feat/issue-197-riley-work-graph-orchestration`
- Base at start: `c9b24363fd24ab63f7376fc4ff5a7106c6268ac2`
- Request mode: update
- Authorization: requester asked to kick off CW-44 with Riley; Persona-Library standing completion authorization applies to the scoped repository implementation unless later narrowed.

## Objective

Add the smallest provider-neutral supervisory capability Riley needs to decompose substantial outcomes into dependency-aware WorkNodes, create and supervise authoritative Dispatches through available runtimes, enforce explicit gates/evidence, recover interrupted work safely, and reconcile completion without becoming an agent runtime or creating a second orchestration database.

## Placement and boundary review

Current source already provides Riley with Agent Workflow Architecture, Task Decomposition and Routing, Tool and Context Design, Risk / Guardrails / Human Oversight, Failure Recovery and Operational Judgment, Current Work continuity, and the bounded-parallel implementation Playbook.

CW-44 adds a distinct **Work Graph Orchestration** Skill because the missing behavior is operational supervision across multiple live execution attempts rather than architecture design alone. The Skill composes those existing capabilities and references the Playbook for repository implementation stages.

Rejected placements:

- **New Persona:** Riley already owns general orchestration.
- **New orchestration database:** Current Work + Work Order + live-system hierarchy is already canonical.
- **New runtime / scheduler / terminal manager:** execution products and runtime surfaces remain replaceable adapters.
- **Vendor-specific Tool package:** provider-specific procedure is not yet stable enough; keep the first contract portable.

## Research basis

CW-44 compared Herdr, Maestro, Vicoa, Orca, Vigilante, Orloj, and FluxRoute. Reused concepts are limited to portable orchestration semantics: explicit lifecycle, stable dispatch identity, work isolation, supervised DAG/dependency behavior, decision gates, read-before-retry recovery, idempotent ownership, observable evidence, and bounded adaptation. No external code is copied.

## Phase status

| Phase | State | Evidence / next action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Capability and schema | in progress | Add callable Skill, Riley application, workflow/guidance, relationships, route, representative Operational Scenario, and focused validator. |
| 2. GitHub execution semantics | planned | Reuse pinned GitHub contract; prove issue/node/dispatch/branch/PR mapping and collision fallback. |
| 3. Runtime-aware dispatch | planned | Prove at least one current execution adapter without embedding provider syntax in the portable Skill. |
| 4. Recovery and resumption | planned | Prove interrupted/stale dispatch recovery from durable identifiers and live state. |
| 5. Validation and learning | planned | Run repository validation, a Riley conformance case, and change-impact reconciliation. |

## Non-goals

- Building another Herdr, Orca, Maestro, Vicoa, Vigilante, or Orloj.
- Adding a distributed queue, worker daemon, scheduler, model gateway, terminal multiplexer, or orchestration database.
- Mirroring volatile GitHub / CI / runtime state into Notion.
- Maximizing agent count.
- Self-learning model/runtime routing in this first implementation.

## Current checkpoint

[C01 | 2026-09-22] Issue #197 created from CW-44 research, placement resolved to a distinct Riley Skill that composes existing orchestration capabilities, branch created from current main, and Phase 1 implementation started.

## Next action

Finish the authored Phase 1 source changes, create a reviewable PR, use repository CI as the execution/validation surface, correct any generated-output or contract failures, and keep #197 open until the runtime and recovery proof phases are demonstrated.
